The data has been split into two groups:<br/>
•	training set (train.csv)<br/>
•	test set (test.csv)<br/>
Data Dictionary<br/>
## Variable-Definition-Key
survival - Survival- 0 = No, 1 = Yes<br/>

sex - Sex	<br/>

sibsp - # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic<br/>	
parch - # of parents / children aboard the Titanic<br/>	
ticket - Ticket number	<br/>
fare - Passenger fare	<br/>

## Variable Notes
pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br/>
1st = Upper<br/>
2nd = Middle<br/>
3rd = Lower<br/>

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5<br/>

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br/>
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister<br/>
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)<br/>

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br/>
Parent = mother, father<br/>
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson<br/>
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them<br/>
